# Deployment Guide

## Prerequisites

* Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed.
* PostgreSQL database running (or configured for your chosen hosting platform).
* Cloudinary account configured with API credentials.
* OpenAI API key.

## Setup Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your environment variables:

DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_connection_string
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
PORT=3000 # Or your preferred port
## Backend Deployment (Node.js/Express.js)

1. **Navigate to the backend directory:** `cd backend`
2. **Install dependencies:** `npm install`
3. **Build the application:**  `npm run build`
4. **Choose your deployment method:**
    * **Heroku:**  Push to Heroku using the Heroku CLI.  Ensure your `Procfile` is correctly configured (e.g., `web: node index.js`).
    * **Netlify:** Deploy from your Git repository. Configure environment variables in Netlify's settings.
    * **AWS (e.g., Elastic Beanstalk):** Follow AWS's deployment instructions for Node.js applications.  Configure environment variables and database access.


## Frontend Deployment (React.js)

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory:** `cd frontend`
2. **Install dependencies:** `npm install`
3. **Build the application:** `npm run build`
4. **Choose your deployment method:**
    * **Heroku:**  Push to Heroku. Configure build settings to use the `build` folder.
    * **Netlify:** Deploy from your Git repository.  Configure build settings to use the `build` folder.  Netlify automatically handles the build process.
    * **AWS (e.g., S3):** Deploy the `build` folder to an S3 bucket. Configure a CloudFront distribution for serving the static files.


## Database Setup

Ensure your database is properly configured and accessible from your deployed applications.  Use the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable for connection details.


## Post-Deployment Checks

* Verify the application is running correctly by accessing it through your deployed URL.
* Test all features, including image uploads and ingredient suggestions.
* Monitor logs for any errors.


##  Important Considerations

* **Security:** Secure your environment variables and API keys. Do not hardcode them in your application code.
* **Scalability:** Choose a hosting platform that can scale to meet your application's needs.
* **Monitoring:** Implement monitoring tools to track application performance and identify issues.
* **HTTPS:** Ensure your application is served over HTTPS.
